                <h2>{{Chapter I – Remembering the rebellion}}</h2>
                <h2>{{Chapter II – The human cost of the war}}</h2>
                <p>In the suburbs of Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, a women tends to vegetables in the farm that surrounds the humble tin-roofed home she shares with two former comrades-in-arms.</p>
                <p>Spring is just around the corner and flowers have started to blossom in these fields in the shadow of the snow-capped Ganesh Himal and Langtang range.</p>
                <p>Rekha Sharma’s gaze drifts off towards the peaks. The 34-year-old really ought to be dead. During Nepal’s 10-year long Maoist rebellion, she had a price on her head.</p>
                <p>The government had announced that it would pay $10,000 to anybody who delivered her to them, dead or alive.</p>
                {'images/1.jpg'}
                <p>But she was lucky; she evaded arrest and, unlike the nearly 16,000 others who were killed during a conflict that lasted from 1996 until 2006, escaped death.</p>
                <p>Nepal’s civil war pitted the Maoist-led People’s Liberation Army (PLA) against Nepal’s state forces. Rekha was a member of the PLA.</p>
                <p>But the gun she used has now been handed in to the government as part of the decommissioning process that began after the war ended. And the party she fought for now sits in the cabinet with those she fought against.</p>
                <p>Still, Rekha’s belief in the communist ideals that inspired her then remains firm. “If necessary, I’m ready to fight again,” she says. The two former comrades with whom she now lives - both women of a similar age - nod in agreement.</p>
                <p>Like thousands of others, these women were drawn to revolutionary politics because they saw in it an opportunity to challenge a patriarchal system that considered them inferior to men. About a third of the PLA fighters were women.</p>
                <p>Rekha was born into an upper caste Brahmin family as Tika Bastola. Her father, a retired Nepalese army solider, was a communist. As a child, his ideas inspired her.</p>
                {'images/2.jpg'}
                <p>When the war began, the university student joined the Maoists’ ‘Kathmandu valley task force’ - many members of which would later be killed, tortured or ‘disappeared’. She admired Mao Zedong, the Chinese communist leader from whom the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), also known as the UCPN(M), drew its inspiration. After unification of several factions in May this year, the party has now been named as Communist of Nepal (Maoist-Centre). “An unjust state which wields weapons can be confronted only with weapons,” she says, her eyes still fixed on the distant mountains.</p>
                <p>For many, the civil war - referred to as the People’s War by the Maoists - was a fight against discrimination and oppressive social hierarchies - whether based on caste, gender, wealth, ethnicity, religion or even region. Rekha met her husband, a fellow fighter, during the war. But just 10 months after their marriage, he was arrested and ‘disappeared’. She blames the army, which is thought to have been behind most of the 1,400 suspected cases of enforced disappearances that took place during the conflict. Rekha almost met the same fate. She recalls one night in 2001, after the government had imposed a state of emergency, when the army raided her hideout in a busy Kathmandu alley. With their hearts racing, she and a male friend pretended to be newlyweds enjoying a trip to the capital. The soldiers believed them.</p>
                <p>Today, Rekha recalls the cruelty of the war, but also the camaraderie and love between the fighters. “I am proud of my husband, he gave his life for the nation. He was a brave man,” she says. She is still waiting to find out exactly what happened to him and the many others like him. “Even if we have to search for another 50 years for the disappeared persons, we are prepared to do that,” she says.</p>
                <h2>{{The teacher soldier - “We will launch another revolution”}}</h2>
                <p>Hundreds of kilometres away from Rekha’s farm, in Ghorahi - one of the largest cities in Nepal’s midwestern region - Kesh Bahadur Batha Magar struggles to contain his excitement. He speaks animatedly when remembering the war, his stories jumping back and forth through time. But they all lead to the same point - for him, the fight is not over. “We will launch another revolution, but it will not be like the last People's War,” he says. His party,  a breakaway Maoist group called the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), enjoys the support of many former Maoist fighters who believe that the mother party, the CPN (Maoist-Centre), made too many compromises after entering government in 2006. Kesh Bahadur remembers an attack on a nearby military barracks that he participated in. It was in 2001 and the group’s first attack on the army. At least 12 soldiers, including the company commander, were killed</p>
